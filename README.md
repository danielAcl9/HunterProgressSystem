## HunterProgressSystem

**HunterProgressSystem** is a gamified habit management system inspired by *Solo Leveling*.  
It represents personal growth as a leveling and experience (XP) mechanic, applying software engineering principles to self-improvement and personal analytics.

---

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build an application capable of recording, calculating, and displaying a user’s progress across multiple areas (Strength, Intelligence, Domain, Faith, etc.) through a system of XP, levels, and progression thresholds.

The system draws inspiration from RPG mechanics and the *Solo Leveling* universe, combining backend development practices and data design to create a scalable engine that will later serve as the foundation for a **full web application** focused on gamified habit tracking.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.13.1  
- **Dependencies:** None (uses only standard libraries such as `os` and `json`)  
- **Architecture:** Modular — separation between entities, repositories, utilities, and data

## Core Concepts

- **Gamified Habits:** Daily actions are transformed into XP and levels.  
- **XP Thresholds:** Scalable XP progression system up to level 50.  
- **Modular Architecture:** Clear separation between domain logic (`entities`), data access (`repositories`), and helpers (`utils`).  
- **Scalability:** Designed to evolve into a REST API or full-featured web application.

---

## Current Usage

At this stage, the system can be executed directly with Python to test the core logic of progression and XP calculation.

python test_progress_system.py

⚙️ Current test scripts validate core entities and progression behavior before building the user-facing interface.
